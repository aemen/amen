 -o FILE, --output=FILE
              Write the resource use statistics to FILE instead of to the
              standard error stream.  By default, this overwrites the file,
              destroying the file's previous contents.  This option is useful
              for collecting information on interactive programs and programs
              that produce output on the standard error stream.

       -a, --append
              Append the resource use information to the output file instead
              of overwriting it.  This option is only useful with the `-o' or
              `--output' option.

       -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
              Use FORMAT as the format string that controls the output of
              time.  See the below more information.

       --help Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

       -p, --portability
              Use the following format string, for conformance with POSIX
              standard 1003.2:
       -v, --verbose
              Use the built-in verbose format, which displays each available
              piece of information on the program's resource use on its own
              line, with an English description of its meaning.

       --quiet
              Do not report the status of the program even if it is different
              from zero.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of time and exit.

7)uname command
